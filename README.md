# Simple Discord Rich Presence Client

## Set Up a Discord Application:

Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
Note down the "Client ID" of your application, as you'll need it when running the program.

## Install Discord RPC Library:

You'll need to install discord-rpc to communicate with Discord's RPC API. You can install it via pip:
```
pip install pypresence
```
